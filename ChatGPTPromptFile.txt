what is a class in JavaScript
In JavaScript, a class is a blueprint for creating objects with similar properties and methods. It allows you to define a template for creating objects with shared characteristics. Classes were introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) and provide syntactic sugar over JavaScript's existing prototype-based inheritance.
class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  greet() {
    return `Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`;
  }
}

// Creating an instance of the Person class
const john = new Person("John", 30);
console.log(john.greet()); // Output: Hello, my name is John and I am 30 years old.
In this example:

Person is the class name.
constructor is a special method for initializing new objects created with this class.
greet is a method defined within the class.
new Person("John", 30) creates a new instance of the Person class with the name "John" and age 30.
